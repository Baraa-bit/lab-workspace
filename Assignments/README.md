# Assignments

This folder contains all course assignments.  

## Submission Instructions
- For **each assignment**, create a **new folder** under this `Assignments` directory.  
  - Example:  
    - `Assignment1/`  
    - `Assignment2/`  
    - `Assignment3/`  
    - `Assignment4/`  
- Inside each assignment folder, include:
  1. **Source Code** – the full project files.  
  2. **Testing Sheet (Word Document)** – a `.docx` file that contains:
     - Screenshots of your app running.  
     - A short explanation of each screenshot.  

## Notes
- Make sure the folder name clearly matches the assignment number.  
- Submissions without the testing sheet will be considered **incomplete**.
